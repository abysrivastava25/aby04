<h4>Components</h4>
<p>
    Blazor apps are built using components. A component is a self-contained chunk of user interface (UI), such as a page, dialog, or form. A component includes HTML markup and the processing logic required to inject data or respond to UI events. Components are flexible and lightweight. They can be nested, reused, and shared among projects.

<h4>Component Parameter</h4>
<p>
    In Blazor we can add parameters to a component using no public properties on the component class by decorating that property with [Parameter] attribute.
